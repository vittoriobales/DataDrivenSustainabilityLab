# DataDrivenSustainabilityLab
Welcome to my repository, where I share a collection of academic projects undertaken during my Bachelor's in Statistical Sciences and my Master's in Greening Energy Market and Finance. This repository serves as a comprehensive showcase of my journey through the realms of machine learning, deep learning, and various data science techniques, all meticulously applied to the intricate worlds of energy markets and sustainability.

The primary objectives of this repository are to:

    - Demonstrate proficiency in statistical sciences and their application in addressing real-world challenges within the sustainability and energy sectors.
    - Explore the cutting-edge intersection of machine learning/deep learning technologies with the fields of sustainability and energy markets.
    - Contribute to the body of knowledge in greening energy markets and finance through innovative data science solutions.
    - Collaborate with peers, educators, and professionals interested in the cross-disciplinary application of statistical and computational methods for a sustainable future.

This repository is built upon a robust stack of data science technologies and libraries, including Python, R, TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, pandas, and more. Emphasis is placed on practical, hands-on applications of these tools in tackling complex problems at the intersection of sustainability, energy markets, and technology.
Collaboration and Contributions

I am keen on collaborating with fellow researchers, students, and professionals who share a passion for data science and its potential to drive positive change in the energy sector and financial markets. Feel free to reach out for collaborations, discussions, or contributions to the projects.
